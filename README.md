# FantasyBaseballProjections

This application is under construction.

I am building a series of fantasy baseball projection tools, utilizing a variety of R data analysis methods via a Shiny webapp.
The tools are designed to be flexible and user friendly.

Currently operational tools: Raw data display, projection aggregation
Under construction: Density plot, standard deviation, histogram analysis of projection rankings; risk analysis tool
that will aggregate pitching, hitting, and injury information to determine player viability
